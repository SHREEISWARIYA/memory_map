NOTES:

NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilot 10.  Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the Notices to Mariners.  Information concerning the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 13th Coast Guard District in Seattle, Washington or at the Office of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Seattle, Washington.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


AUTHORITIES
Hydrography and topography by the National Ocean Service, Coast Survey, With additional data from the Corps of Engineers, Geological Survey, and U.S. Coast Guard.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR
153).


CAUTION - LIMITATIONS
Limitations on the use of radio signals as aids to marine navigation can be found in the U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117. Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial broadcasting stations are subject to error and should be used with caution.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to navigation are not indicated. See Local Notice to Mariners.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and submarine cables may exist within the area of this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and submarine cables are required to be buried, and those that were originally buried may have become exposed. Mariners should use extreme caution when operating vessels in depths of water comparable to their draft in areas where pipelines and cables may exist, and when anchoring, dragging, or trawling. Covered wells may be marked by lighted or unlighted buoys.


NOAA WEATHER RADIO BROADCASTS
The NOAA Weather Radio stations listed below provide continuous weather broadcasts. The reception range is typically 37 to 74 kilometers / 20 to 40 nautical miles from the antenna site, but can be as much as 185 kilometers / 100 nautical miles for stations at high elevations. 
 
Coos Bay, OR          KIH-32   162.400 MHz
Eugene, OR            KEC-42   162.400 MHz
Newport, OR           KIH-33   162.550 MHz
Florence, OR          WNG-674  162.500 MHz


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information concerning aids to navigation.


RADAR REFLECTORS
Rader reflectors have been placed on many floating aids to navigation. Individual radar reflector identification on these aids has been omitted from this chart.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation, particularly on floating aids. See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


CAUTION - VESSEL TRANSITING 
The U.S. Coast Guard and the Pacific States/British Columbia Oil Spill Task Force endorse a system of voluntary measures and minimum distances from shore for certain commercial vessels transiting along the coast anywhere between Cook Inlet, Alaska and San Diego, California. See U.S. Coast Pilot 10, Chapter 3 for details.
