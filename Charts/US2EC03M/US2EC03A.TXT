NOTES:

NOTE A
Navigation regulations are published in Chapter 2, U.S. Coast Pilots 1, 2, 3 and 4. Additions or revisions to Chapter 2 are published in the Notice to Mariners. Information concerning the regulations may be obtained at the Office of the Commander, 1st Coast Guard District in Boston, MA or the 5th Coast Guard District in Portsmouth, VA or at the Offices of the District Engineer, Corps of Engineers in Concord, MA, New York, NY, and Philadelphia, PA, Norfolk, VA, or Wilmington, NC.
Refer to charted regulation section numbers.


CAUTION - TEMPORARY CHANGES
Temporary changes or defects in aids to navigation are not indicated. See Local Notice to Mariners. During some winter months or when endangered by ice, certain aids to navigation are replaced by other types or removed.  For details see U.S. Coast Guard Light List.


CAUTION - USE OF RADIO SIGNALS (LIMITATIONS)
Limitations on the use of radio signals as aids to marine navigation can be found in the U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Publication 117. Radio direction-finder bearings to commercial broadcasting stations are subject to error and should be used with caution.


CAUTION - SUBMARINE PIPELINES AND CABLES
Additional uncharted submarine pipelines and submarine cables may exist within the area of this chart. Not all submarine pipelines and submarine cables are required to be buried, and those that were originally buried may have become exposed. Mariners should use extreme caution when operating vessels in depths of water comparable to their draft in areas where pipelines and cables may exist, and when anchoring, dragging, or trawling. Covered wells may be marked by lighted or unlighted buoys.


WARNING - PRUDENT MARINER
The prudent mariner will not rely solely on any single aid to navigation, particularly on floating aids.  See U.S. Coast Guard Light List and U.S. Coast Pilot for details.


POLLUTION REPORTS
Report all spills of oil and hazardous substances to the National Response Center via 1-800-424-8802 (toll free), or to the nearest U.S. Coast Guard facility if telephone communication is impossible (33 CFR 153).


HURRICANES AND TROPICAL STORMS
Hurricanes, tropical storms and other major storms may cause considerable damage to marine structures, aids to navigation and moored vessels, resulting in submerged debris in unknown locations. Charted soundings, channel depths and shoreline may not reflect actual conditions following these storms. Fixed aids to navigation may have been damaged or destroyed. Buoys may have been moved from their charted positions, damaged, sunk, extinguished or otherwise made inoperative. Mariners should not rely upon the position or operation of an aid to navigation. Wrecks and submerged obstructions may have been displaced from charted locations. Pipelines may have become uncovered or moved. 
Mariners are urged to exercise extreme caution and are requested to report aids to navigation discrepancies and hazards to navigation to the nearest United States Coast Guard unit.


TRAFFIC SEPARATION SCHEME
One way traffic lanes are recommended for use by all vessels traveling between the points involved. They have been designed to aid in the prevention of collisions at the approaches to Portland and New York Harbors and the approach to Narragansett Bay, Buzzards Bay, Boston Harbor and Chesapeake Bays but are not intended in an way to supersede or alter the applicable Rules of the Road. Separation Zones are intended to separate inbound and outbound traffic and to be free of ship traffic. Separation zones should not be used except for crossing purposes. When crossing traffic lanes and separation zones use extreme caution. Recommended traffic lanes in the Bay of Fundy and at the approach to Saint John Harbor have been established by the Department of Transport, Canada. See large scale Canadian charts


RADAR REFLECTORS
Radar reflectors have been placed on many floating aids to navigation. Individual radar reflector identification on these aids has been omitted from this chart.


AIDS TO NAVIGATION
Consult U.S. Coast Guard Light List for supplemental information concerning aids to navigation. See Canadian List of Lights, Buoys and Fog Signals for information not included in the U.S. Coast Guard Light List.
